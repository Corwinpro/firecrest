## Main project stages

### Geometry and mesh modules

#### Major tasks

1. Find a good approach and implement BoundaryConditions.
2. Integration with solver module.
3. Implement variational forms for different problem types.

#### Minor tasks

1. Geometry to JSON format: reusable geometry definition from templates.
2. Implementing special boundary elements: arc, ellipse.
3. 3D compatibility.

### Solver modules

### Optimization modules
